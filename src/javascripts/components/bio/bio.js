I created him a set of ABC flashcards with MS Publisher and went to FedEx Kinkos to have them printed and laminated. He enjoyed the cards and was on the road to learning his ABCs.</p>';
  domString += '<p> However, like most toddlers, He was curious about the object I carried everywhere with us that could play the YouTube videos of his favorite shows, my smartphone. I had an idea to cross my mind to get him even more excited about learning his ABCs. I would make a PowerPoint presentation to represent the cards we were using in his learning. I projected my laptop screen to our TV to display the ABC app and let him use a wireless mouse to navigate through the app. After a few sessions together, he no longer needed my assistance, and he was learning by playing. </p>';
  domString += '<p> Now, as I approach the conclusion of Bootcamp at NSS, I plan to use this new skill set to benefit my community and family.</p>';
