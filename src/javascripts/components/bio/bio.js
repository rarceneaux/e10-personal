After receiving my MBA from MTSU in Finance I began my career in the financial services industry with UBS. My first introduction to coding came while teaching my youngest son the alphabet when he was 18 months old. My strong value of education influenced my passion for making sure my son had access to an easy and efficient way to learn his foundational language skills. I decided to create an application to aid in early education of these fundamental skills. After meeting with software firms to discuss creating a MVP prototype for my idea, I decided to make my own prototype with Microsoft Powerpoint. My son enjoyed playing the application and it was successful in educating him. After sharing my MVP with a few firms, one representative I spoke with suggested I research becoming a developer. Realizing how much I truly enjoyed development and seeing first hand that the applications you build can make a positive impact, I decided to make the change. I am excited for my new career in technology, and the opportunity it will give me to continuously learn and challenge myself.</p>';
